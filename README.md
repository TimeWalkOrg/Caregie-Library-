# The Carnegie Library
52 Lovell Avenue, Mill Valley, CA 94941

## Building History

Mill Valley's first public library owed the origins of its collections to the Outdoor Art Club, a nonprofit organization founded in 1902 by a group of women dedicated to the protection and preservation of Mill Valley's natural beauty. The Outdoor Art Club donated its private collection of books to the city in 1908, following the approval of a bond measure that included $2,500 for acquisition of a library site. The books were housed in temporary locations for two years until finally, in 1910, the city was able to secure a Carnegie grant of $10,000 for the construction of a library building (Source: [Carnegie Libraries of California](http://www.carnegie-libraries.org/california/millvalley.html)).

Property had already been purchased by the city in 1909 for $2,000. This property, on Lovell at Madrona, became the site of the new library. Architect C. H. Russell designed the building at 52 Lovell Avenue, and Robert Trost was the builder. The Carnegie Library opened its doors to the public on July 22, 1911 under the supervision of librarian Lillian Gardner. 

By the late 1930s, the library’s popularity had grown such that “there was talk of moving to a larger facility” (Source: [Then and Now: Mill Valley](https://patch.com/california/millvalley/then-and-now-mill-valley-library)). “When the new city library in Old Mill Park was completed in 1966, the Carnegie building was sold to a private purchaser for $16,000. It has since been resold, and has served as both multiple and single family residences and studios. The Carnegie cornerstone is on display in the History Room of the current library."
