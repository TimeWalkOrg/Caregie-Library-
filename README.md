# The Carnegie Library
52 Lovell Avenue, Mill Valley, CA 94941

## Building History

Mill Valley's first library owed its beginnings to the Outdoor Art Club, a women’s group “dedicated to the ‘protection of trees and birds.’” The Outdoor Art Club’s private collection of books was given to the city in 1908, after voters had approved a bond measure that included $2,500 for the acquisition of a library site. The city used this bond money to purchase property on Lovell and Madrona for $2,000 in 1909. 

After two years--during which the books donated by the Outdoor Art Club were housed in a series of temporary locations--the city finally received a Carnegie grant of $10,000 in 1910 for the construction of a library building. Architect C. H. Russell designed this new building at 52 Lovell Avenue, and Robert Trost was the builder. The Carnegie Library opened its doors to the public on July 22, 1911 under the supervision of librarian Lillian Gardner. 

By the late 1930s, the library’s popularity had grown such that “there was talk of moving to a larger facility” (Source: [Then and Now: Mill Valley](https://patch.com/california/millvalley/then-and-now-mill-valley-library)). “When the new city library in Old Mill Park was completed in 1966, the Carnegie building was sold to a private purchaser for $16,000. It has since been resold, and has served as both multiple and single family residences and studios. The Carnegie cornerstone is on display in the History Room of the current library."
